# Flat Design Examples

<div class="example-grid">

<div class="example-card">
  <img src="/public/images/image.png" alt="Example 1">
  <h3>Example 1</h3>
  <p>This is Flat Design because it uses bright, saturated colors, strong geometric shapes (like blocks and cards), and completely avoids three-dimensional elements like shadows, gradients, and textures, emphasizing clarity and simplicity.</p>
</div>

<div class="example-card">
  <img src="/public/images/image2.png" alt="Example 2">
  <h3>Example 2</h3>
  <p>The provided images demonstrate Flat Design primarily because the aesthetic relies on minimalist, two-dimensional elements, strong geometric shapes, and a lack of depth cues like shadows or gradients. This style prioritizes clarity, usability, and typography over detailed ornamentation or realistic textures.</p>
