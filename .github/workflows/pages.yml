    # 💥 FINAL FIX: Add permissions block for deployment
    permissions:
      contents: write # Allows the action to push to the repository (e.g., gh-pages)
      pages: write    # Required for GitHub Pages deployment
      id-token: write # Required for deployment systems

      # 💥 CRUCIAL FIX: Explicitly grant execute permission to all binaries.
      # This forces the resolution of the persistent 'Permission denied' error (Exit Code 127).
